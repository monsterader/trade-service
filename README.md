# Monsterader Trade Service
As Monsterader, we would like to share our "Trade Service" middleware application as an option for those who want to run the trading strategies that we have developed and put into service on TradingView autonomously.

It is an application that we will continue to develop over time and is completely open to the community.

For the first release, it only works with BTCUSDTPERP on Binance. We will do our best to support more pairs and more platforms in the coming periods.

However, if you want to add your own platform or parities to this application, it is quite easy! Feel free to contribute!
